.TH vncserver 1 "" "TigerVNC" "Virtual Network Computing"
.SH NAME
vncserver \- start a VNC server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vncserver
.RI [: display# ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vncserver
is used to start a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) desktop.
.B vncserver
is a Perl script which simplifies the process of starting an Xvnc server.  It
runs Xvnc with appropriate options and starts a window manager on the VNC
desktop.

.B vncserver
can be run with no options at all. In this case it will choose the first
available display number (usually :1), start Xvnc with that display number,
and start the default window manager in the Xvnc session.  You can also
specify the display number, in which case vncserver will attempt to start
Xvnc with that display number and exit if the display number is not
available.  For example:

.RS
vncserver :13
.RE

vncserver will exit once the started session exits.

.SH FILES
Several VNC-related files are found in the directory $HOME/.vnc:
.TP
/etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults
The optional system-wide equivalent of $HOME/.vnc/config. If this file exists
and defines options to be passed to Xvnc, they will be used as defaults for
users. The user's $HOME/.vnc/config overrides settings configured in this file.
The overall configuration file load order is: this file, $HOME/.vnc/config,
and then /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory. None are required to exist.
.TP
/etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory
The optional system-wide equivalent of $HOME/.vnc/config. If this file exists
and defines options to be passed to Xvnc, they will override any of the same
options defined in a user's $HOME/.vnc/config. This file offers a mechanism
to establish some basic form of system-wide policy. WARNING! There is
nothing stopping users from constructing their own vncserver-like script
that calls Xvnc directly to bypass any options defined in
/etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory. The overall configuration file load
order is: /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults, $HOME/.vnc/config, and then
this file. None are required to exist.
.TP
$HOME/.vnc/config
An optional server config file wherein options to be passed to Xvnc are listed
to avoid hard-coding them to the physical invocation. List options in this file
one per line. For those requiring an argument, simply separate the option from
the argument with an equal sign, for example: "geometry=2000x1200" or
"securitytypes=vncauth,tlsvnc". Options without an argument are simply listed
as a single word, for example: "localhost" or "alwaysshared".

The special option
.B session
can be used to control which session type will be started. This should match
one of the files in \fI/usr/share/xsessions\fP. E.g. if there is a file called
"gnome.desktop", then "session=gnome" would be set to use that session type.
.TP
$HOME/.vnc/passwd
The VNC password file.

VNC was originally developed by the RealVNC team while at Olivetti
Research Ltd / AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.  TightVNC additions were
implemented by Constantin Kaplinsky. Many other people have since
participated in development, testing and support. This manual is part
